# Implementation Guide's Inferno test suite generator

This Ruby gem provides the ability to generate a list of Inferno Tests from the Implementation Guide archive in the .tgz format.

The current state is UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Initially, this generator is a copy-pasted generator from the AU Core Inferno Suite, which is a modified generator from the US Core Inferno Suite.

We want to provide a comfortable and informative tool for implementers of any FHIR Implementation Guide.

Development steps:

    Implement an ability to use a generator with input/output folders
    The general metadata file should be generated
    A simple search test should be implemented ....
